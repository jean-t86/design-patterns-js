## General Informaton
This repository contains example and template code for design patterns in javascript.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Setup
In order to run the program, you need to install Node.js on your computer:
* [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the binaries
* If you use Linux, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux).

Once installed, install the program's dependencies with `npm install` in your terminal with the project's folder as working directory.

You can then run the program by typing `node index.js`.

## Running the examples
Each design pattern is contained within it's own folder. Each folder contains the code implementation for the pattern along with an `index.js` file.

Each `index.js` file contains example code for how to use the pattern.

For example, to run the example code for the builder pattern, type `node builder/index.js` in your command line.
